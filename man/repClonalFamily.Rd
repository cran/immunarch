\alias{repClonalFamily}
\title{This function uses PHYLIP package to make phylogenetic analysis. For making trees it uses
maximum parsimony methods.}
\usage{
repClonalFamily(.data, .threads, .nofail)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{The data to be processed. Can be output of repAlignLineage() with normal
or verbose output; variants with one sample and list of samples are both supported.}

\item{.threads}{Number of threads to use.}

\item{.nofail}{Return NA instead of stopping if PHYLIP is not installed.
Used to avoid raising errors in examples on computers where PHYLIP is not installed.}
}
\value{
Dataframe or list of dataframes (if input is a list with multiple samples).
The dataframe has these columns:
* Cluster: cluster name
* Germline.Input: germline sequence, like it was in the input; not trimmed and not aligned
* Germline.Output: germline sequence, parsed from PHYLIP dnapars function output;
  it contains difference of germline from the common ancestor; "." characters mean
  matching letters. It's usually shorter than Germline.Input, because germline and
  clonotype sequences were trimmed to the same length before alignment.
* Common.Ancestor: common ancestor sequence, parsed from PHYLIP dnapars function output
* Trunk.Length: mean trunk length, representing the distance between the most recent
  common ancestor and germline sequence as a measure of the maturity of a lineage
* Tree: output tree in "phylo" format, loaded from by PHYLIP dnapars function output
}
\description{
This function builds a phylogenetic tree using the sequences of a clonal lineage
